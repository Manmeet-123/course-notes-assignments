## Intro to Machine Learning
* What is machine learning - different definitions for ML - all involve learning by a machine
* can machines be enables to learn without being explicitly programmed
* Learning and adaptation
* data representation - feature extraction: raw data (images) -> features
* different types of data representations
   * numerical; categorical; ordinal (ranking)
     * univariate or multivariate
     * all could be represented by numbers
   * graphical representations in terms of nodes & edges - ex. social network analysis
* preprocessing for feature extraction
   * segmentation
   * filtering
   * various transformations
   * all intended for facilitating feature extracting
   * good features should be invariant in some sense
* mathematical models for classification
   * linear model 
* importance of statistical modeling
   * why we often rely on statistical methods in machine learning?
   * data is noisy (measurement noise) -> features are often represented random variables/vectors
   * inaccuracy of the assumed model 
   * inherent ambiguity of many real-world problems
* Basic ML Paradigms
   * supervised learning: the training samples have labels (classification, regression)
   * unsupervised learning: the training set is not labeled (Clustering, density estimation)
   * reinforcement learning: learning to take actions to maximize some notion of reward
  
## Machine Learning Applications
* few examples
   * learning to assess skills in simulation-based laparoscopic surgery training
   * learning to predict best answers in community Q&A
   * tag prediction/recommendation (multimodal data)
   * diabetic retinopathy detection (multiple instance learning)
   * visual saliency detection
   * computational visual aesthetics
* Broad applications of ML
   * computer vision
   * speech recognition; nlp
   * medical informatics
   * robotics
   * computational biology
   * information technology
     * spam detection, web image search, recommendation, information filtering, community detection, adaptive advertisement, sentiment analysis  
   * finance
     * credit risk assessment, fraud detection, stock market prediction, algorithmic trading, return forecasting
