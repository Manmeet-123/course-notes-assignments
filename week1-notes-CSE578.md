## What is Visualization?
* the use of computer-supported interactive visual representations of data to amplify cognition
* Not - not simply the process of making a graphic or an image, the goal is to create insight, not pretty pictures
* we want to help ppl form a mental image of something and internalize their own understanding
* we want to promote discovery, decision making and explanations
* we want to find and utilize cognitive and perceptual principles
* we want to optimize our visualizations and our interactions with the visualization according to those principles
* Why is it helpful?
   * amplifies cognition
   * expands working memory
   * reduces search time
   * improves pattern detection and recognition
   * controls attention
*  1 - analysis - understand your data better and act upon that understanding
*  2 - given a data set, compare, contrast, assess, evaluate
*  3 - solve a problem!
*  4 - presentation - communicate and inform others more effectively
*  5 - visualization is most useful in exploratory data analysis

## Intro to Data Exploration
* how can we make sense of real world data we collect
* "sense" making.. what does it mean?
* 1st sense: from latin "sentire" or "to perceive" - any of the faculties, as sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch, by which humans and animals perceive stimuli originating from outside the body
* 2nd sense: to attain awareness or understanding of... - awareness implies vigilance in observing or alertness in drawing inferences from what one experiences; understanding is the power to make experience intelligible by applying concepts and categories
* Did you notice the gap? there is a gap btwn the first meaning (feel, measurement) and the second (awareness, understanding)
* data processing - user knows what she wants; user has a function/procedure/workflow to compute what she wants
* querying - user knows what she wants; user can describe what she wants
* navigation - user knows what he wants; user doesn't know how to describe/locate what they want
* exploration - user does not precisely know what they want; user wants to get an idea about the available data
* exploratory search - acquiring new knowledge and revealing new facts; analysis, comparison, aggregation, transformation, visualization

## Data Challenges
* human challenges - for many applications the final consumer is human
* 3Vs - volume, velocity, variety
