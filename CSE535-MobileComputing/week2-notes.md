## Context Models and Context Aware Apps
### What is Context?
* Context means the state of the environment (not really a useful definition by itself, but will build upon this initial definition later)
* As humans we use context to adapt our behavior to the current situation/state
* We can use context in mobile computing to avoid interupting users in inappropriate situations or to create smart environments (discover and use nearby interaction devices, or turn devices on/off depending upon time, situation)
* Proactivity - set up env. according to preferences or usage history
* Context:
    * location, identities
    * time, temperature
    * emotional state, focus, tasks
    * env. that user and comp. know about
    * state of surroundings
 * Two main classes of context information are **human factors** and **physical environment**
 
### Context Definitions
* Information that can be used by a comp. to enhance interaction with it (example: train booking app - cust no. and booking details, location and time can be derived from context info)
* **Definition by Enumeration** - whatever information is available
* **Definition by Relevance** - enumerate only the relevant information 
* Times change (introduction of IoT) and lead to new definitions of context
* **Definition by Functionality and Relevance** - only refer to info as context that can actually be processed by an application (relevant) but that is not mandatory for its normal functionality (auxiliary information - what other info can be collected in order to enable an additional functionality)

### Types of Context Aware Applications
* Features include **presentation** of info and services, **automatic execution** of a service, **tagging of context** to info to support later retrieval, and **adaptation** of apps behavior and appearance
* Presentation:
    * present info relevant to current information
    * only refers to which info is presented (not how)
* Automatic Execution:
