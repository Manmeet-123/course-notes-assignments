# Week 4
## Mobile Banking Apps, Medical Control Apps and Safety Security Interrelation
### Security in Mobile Apps
* configuration management problem - excessive privileges, insufficient input validation, poor session mgmt, privacy violation, insecure external connectivity
* medical control apps - resource constraints in sensors and actuators, poor software development support for sensors and actuators, real-tine reqs of health apps
### Safety Security Interrelation
* security vulnerability exploited to cause harm
* security protocols introduce unexpected delays in control operation
* improper safety assurance policies compromise security (critically aware access control)
## Traditional Security Protocols
* what is network security:
* confidentiality
* authentication - confirm identity
* message integrity
* access and availability
* Intruders can eavesdrop, insert, impersonate, hijack, denial of service
### Cryptography
* encrypt clear text into cipher text
* encryption scheme depends not on secrecy of algorithm but on parameter of algorithm
* extremely difficult for an intruder to determine key
* 2 basic types: symmetric key, asymmetric or public/private key
### Message Integrity
### Digital Signatures
### Network Security Authentication
