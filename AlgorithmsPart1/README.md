# Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms - Part 1 of 4

The primary topics in this part of the algorithm specialization are: asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).

> **Note:** With most courses, I supplement what I learn with additional reading on the topics from published papers or textbooks. The books I've read in addition to this course are [Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_2?crid=WFN9GGKJHG4X&keywords=introduction+to+algorithms&qid=1649899653&sprefix=introduction%2Caps%2C142&sr=8-2) and [Common Sense Guide to Data Structure and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NK8TWOMWZIXW&keywords=common+sense+guide+to+data+structures+and+algorithms&qid=1649899679&sprefix=common+sense+%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-1). Common Sense Guide is very intuitive and beginner-friendly, whereas CLRS Algorithms may require some prerequisite knowledge (for example in discrete mathematics) to make it more of a palatable read.
