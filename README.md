# CS Course Notes and Assignments

A compilation of notes and assignments for courses related to my CS degree.

> **Computer science** deals with idealized components. We know as much as we want about these little program and data pieces that we're fitting things together. We don't have to worry about tolerance. And that means that, in building a large program, there's not all that much difference between what I can build and what I can imagine, because the parts are these abstract entities that I know as much as I want. 
> 
> I know about them as precisely as I'd like. So as opposed to other kinds of engineering, where the constraints on what you can build are the constraints of physical systems, the constraints of physics and noise and approximation, **the constraints imposed in building large software systems are the limitations of our own minds.** \
