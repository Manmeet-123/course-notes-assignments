#### Please  compare and contrast substitution method and integration by parts method.

Both substitution and integration by parts are tools for solving integrals, but they go about solving them in different ways. Substitution would be good to use when a function and its derivative exist in the integral (  ∫f(g(x))g′(x)dx  ).Integration by parts is useful when you have two unrelated functions that are multiplied together-- one that you can integrate and one you can differentiate. Integration by parts would also be good to use when logarithmic functions (ln x) or inverse trigonometric functions are involved. 

#### Which differentiation rules are they reversing?

The substitution method is reversing the chain rule and integration by parts is reversing product rules.

#### Which method is more universal?

Substitution would be considered more universal.
