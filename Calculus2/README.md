# Calculus II

> Unfortunately, I was unable to get my credits earned from my high school test score for AP Calculus BC to cover the Calc. II requirement for my masters program. Soo, I guess I'm relearning Calculus. It's like riding a bike, right?

**Note:** Most of the graded assignments come in the form of mini-quizzes. I will post my work after the submission date and any corrections that needed to be made. Please don't copy my work verbatum (for the obvious reason, but also I could have gotten it completely wrong).
