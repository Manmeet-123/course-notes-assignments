**Topic:** \
How are a function and its Taylor series connected. Do we start with the series and get a function or the other way round, start with a function and get the Taylor series?

**Response:** \
In general, we start with a function and get the Taylor series. The Taylor series is an expansion of some function into an infinite sum of terms.

For example:

the Taylor series of e^x is equal to the infinite sum of terms 1 + x + x2/2! + x3/3! +...  

Even though the Taylor series is an infinite sum of terms, if we want to approximate a function numerically we can take the first few terms (a finite amount) of the Taylor series expansion of the function and get a polynomial approximation of that function.
