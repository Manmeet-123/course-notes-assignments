### Introduction to Mining
* How mining works
  * Uses hash functions - SHA256
  * Iteratively hashing block header (change the nonce and hash again)
  * Hash has to be small enough (a low enough number)
  * Valid block submitted to the network
  * Mining protocols (difficulty parameter)
* Exahashes every second
