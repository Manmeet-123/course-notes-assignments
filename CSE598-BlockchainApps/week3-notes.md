### Introduction to the Projective Plane
* Affine
* Projective - same except with extra point (infinity) 
- Projective plane consists of the points in the affine plane
plus extra points at infinity.
- Projective geometry is used because projective objects have
the property of being compact
- Finite Field with 5 elements consists of 31 points (
52+51+50=31 )
### Curve on the Projective Plane
- An elliptic curve is a degree three (cubic) curve that is
nonsingular; “head and shoulder” shape.
- Two parallel lines in the projective plane will intersect at
infinity
- Bezout’s theorem states a curve of degree 3 and a curve of
degree 5 will intersect 15 times (3 * 5)
- Elliptic curve equation used by Bitcoin and Dash –
y 2 =x 3 +7(Called “Weierstrass form”)
- Operation “+” for O + P = P where O was a special point
called an identity point, like zero.

### Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures Algorithm (ECDSA)
- Private key is number and public key is point on elliptic
curve

### Combinations
- Travelling salesman is an example of combinatorics
- nCr = n! / (n-r)!r!
- Pascal’s Triangle Binomial Distribution
- p+q = 1
- n trials expression nCx∗px∗qn−x
