# Week 3 Notes

### Risk Management
* identify what can go wrong
* RE = P(adverse event)*consequences
* We can minimize the consequences to reduce the overall risk exposure once calculated

### Risk Identification
* Risk is the combination of the probability of an abnormal event or failure and the consequences of that event or failure to a projects success or systems performance
* Risk assessment is the process and procedures of identifying, characterizing, quantifying, and evaluating risks and their significance
* Risk management is any technique used to either to minimize the probability of an adverse event or to mitigate its consequences with good engineering design, good operating practices, and/or preventative maintenance
* The key to a successful software project is to take the right risks at the right time
   * avoiding risks at all times is not good
   * taking too many risks is bad
* Risk mgmgt is critical when balancing quality, cycle time, and cost considerations
* Hierarchy: stage 1 crisis reaction (fire fighting), stage 2 risk mgmt (measures taken to prevent, *recovery* a plan made to deal with the consequences that occur due to risk), stage 3 elimination of the root causes of the risk
* SEI Model for Continuous Risk Management: Step 1 Identify Risk, Step 2 Analyze and prioritize risk, Step 3 Mitigate Risk, Step 4 Monitor Risk
* Risk identification approaches - periodic risk assessments, continuous risk identification and communication: an agenda item for team meeting
* Periodic risk assessments - held at the beginning of the project, monthly and at key milestones; might utilize a checklist similar to SEI taxonomy based questionnaire; important to review lessons learned
* Continuous risk id - identified risks must be communicated at scheduled project status meetings; everyone should be able to report risks without concerns
* risk vs uncertainty: risk involves dealing with known unknowns, whereas uncertainty deals with unknown unknowns

### Risk Assessment
* step 2 analyze risks - determine the probability of the risk occurring (qualitatively or quantitatively); assess the consequences of the risk; determine the overall risk
* qualitative probability assessment - very likely, probable, improbable, impossible
* assess impact with respect to product performance, project (cost,schedule), product life cycle support
* The degree of impact must be assessed for each of the impact areas
* SEI qualitative - catastrophic, critical, marginal
* determine the overall risk for each risk item - the overall risk of each item is the product of its probability of occurrence and its potential impact
* risks should be ordered in terms of decreasing impact

* the probability of a risk item should be expressed quantitatively as a number between 0 and 100
* the degree of impact must be assessed for each of the impact areas
* the degree of impact should be expressed in terms of dollars
* hazards
* the decision to mitigate a risk is based on its impact on Management Reserve (MR)
* when a risk becomes reality, it is no longer a risk. Move its impact into Estimate at Complete (EAC)
* Some mitigation costs are part of the project budget. Some should be allocated from MR

* accept risk when there is high probability of the risk occurring but a very small negligible impact on the task

### Risk Mitigation
* Once the project risks have been identified and analyzed the set of risks to be managed must be selected
* Select those risks to manage where the benefirts outweight the costs (leverage risks, insurtance deductible analogy)
* Risk tradeoffs - interrelationships may exist among risks; actions taken to reduce one risk may increase another; be careful during risk mgmt to ensure that these interrelationships
* reduce the probability of the risk occurring
* reduce the potential impact of the risk, should it occur (contingency planning): 
* mitigation actions for one risk might impact another risk
* risk mitigation for loss of key personnel is to develop a contingency plan involving hiring consultants

#### Taxonomy-based Risk Identification
* checklist for risk identification

### People Management
* Soft skills
* In traditional project - project manager manages the project timeline, resources, and scope in order to meet business requirements
* in agile - a scrum master is a coach and facilitator 
* program manager - involved in hiring, firing, budgeting, performance reviews, and mentoring
