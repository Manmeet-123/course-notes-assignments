# Week 2 Notes

### Project Planning: Task Identification
* 9 management best practices from the SPMN: 
   * Formal Risk Management
   * Agreement on Interfaces - user interfaces myuust be defined before development
   * Formal Inspections - work products
   * Metric-Based Scheduling and Management - analytics
   * Binary Quality Gates at the Inch-Pebble level
   * Program-wide visibility of progress vs plan
   * Defect tracking against quality targets
   * Configuration management
   * People aware management accountability - 90 percentile software teams outperform 15 percentile teams by factors of 4 or 5 to 1, individual productivity ranges of 26:1, minimize burn-out, avoid excessive overtime, just-in-time training
* Software Planning Activities - identify external constraints (body count, project inputs and outputs), identify tasks to be performed, analyze dependencies among tasks, estimate the effort, expertise and other resources need to perform each task
* assess training and resources needs
* assign task responsibilities: resource level tasks
* map tasks to a timeline
* obtain commitment from participants
* Identify task to be performed - tasks to be performed must be identified based on the life cycle model, the selected development process, the contract, and the review of schedules from related programs
* task identification proceeds in a top down fashion until tasks are identified that: can be assigned to an individual or group, are small enough that they can be estimated accurately, are precise enough to identify interdependencies
* Work Breakdown Structure: Project into Reqs, Development and testing
* Agile task identification: product backlog, sprint backlog
* Which key aspects contribute to identifying the tasks to be performed? Life Cycle Model, selected development process, contract, review of schedules
* task identification is an essential first step in project planning and will vary based on the development process model

### Project Planning: Dependency Analysis
* after identifying tasks, peform a dependency analysis among the tasks: plan, discuss, and brainstorm seq of events; understand external dependencies
* Dependencies can be documented in a PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) chart
*
