# Week 6 Notes

### Software Process Improvement
* Developing, testing, maintaining
* Process Improvement Phases:
* **Characterize the current process**
    * understanding the current process is important
    * excercise care in distinguishing among: 
      * the perceived process: what you think you do
      * official process: what you're supposed to do
      * actual process: what you do
    * software leader must ensure that the **actual process** being followed is understood prior to commencing any process improvement
* **Analyze current process**
  * identify value-added and non-value-added activities
  * identify the sources of variation in the process
  * software metrics play a key role in objective process analysis
  * the software leader must plan to collect the appropriate metrics as previously described
* **Characterize Target Process**
  * identify the ultimate goal of the process: for example - minimize cycle time, minimize late reqs
* Process re-design
  * improve the current process in the direction of the target process
  * explore ways for eliminating, simplifying, or combining activities
  * explore ways of elim. rework
  * explore ways of reducing the task variance
* **Implement Process Improvement**
  * set process improvement goals
  * implement process improvements: begin with candidates that are well defined, pilot candidates that are not proven
  * measure progress towards goals
* Process improvement tools: post mortem
  * a set of lessons learned is documented
  * post mortem analysis techniques include:
    * interviews with key personnel
    * statistical analysis of data
    * investigations of major problems
    * identification of what went well
* Process improvement: causal analysis
  * seeks to identify both the root cause of defects and also approaches to eliminate future occurrences
  * defect data is collected and analyzed:
    * currently done informally within projects
    * information can be used to support organization process improvement
* causal analysis steps: select a set of defects to analyze, identify the probable cause for each defect, identify common causes among defects, identify possible solutions to eliminate the common defect causes, tools are available to support causal analysis activities
