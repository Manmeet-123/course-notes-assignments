# Week 1

#### Software Development History
* Complexity factors of software development: High cost, Difficult to manage, Poor reliability, Lack of user acceptance, Difficult to maintain

#### Software Development SOA
* Current state is still there with the same challenges as mentioned above
* **High cost** - software development is labor intensive, software productivity rates for engineering are around 1 loc (lines of code) per hour
* Off The Shelf Software and Hardware costs have both dropped dramatically overtime
* **Difficult to Manage** - software projects are difficult to estimate, plan, and track, many projects are late and over budget
* **Poor Reliability** - software defect rates are around 1 delivered defect per thousand lines of code, with applications spanning millions of line of code, customers experience many defects
* CRUD (Customer Reported Unique Defects)
* **Lack of User Acceptance** - In the "old days", customers tolerated a lot of cryptic interfaces (e.g. JCL), Today the success of a project is often a function of its GUI
* **Difficult to Maintain** - Despite advances in languages and methodologies, software is still difficult to maintain, maintenance requires both knowledge of the cose as well as the application domain
* **Time to Market** - software takes too long
