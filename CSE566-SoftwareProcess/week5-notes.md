### Global Software Development
* entails geographically distributed team developing, testing and maintaining software
* What are the motivations?
   * cost reduction
   * insufficient sources locally
   * access to world-class capabilities and tech
   * proximity to markets
   * sharing benefits of resources from diff cultures & backgrounds
   * flexibility in skill mgmt
   * reduced cycle time
* Challenges to GSD:
   * Lack of strategy & shared values
   * Insufficient communication
   * Cultural differences
   * Dispersed work organization
   * Inadequate global mgmt
   * Isolated learning
   * Insufficient contract mgmt
   * Unknown legal environment
   * Different turnover rates
  
#### Scrum Practices and Global Software Development
* Literature review
* Benefits of global dev - improved quality, cheaper resources
* Challenges - collaboration and coordination (set of synchronized actions)
* How do you scale scrum?
* Utilizing Scrum - Sprint 0, then have potentially multiple scrum teams
* Have to have a mechanism
* SoS (Scrum of Scrums) - a representative of team goes into an equivalent of a stand up meeting

#### SWOT for Scaling Agile Methods in Global Software Development
* Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats
* Literature review
* 4 research questions - what the factors that contribute the most to large scale agile operations? Positive influences, negative influences, what are the most critical factors of both
* 6 most critical factors: feedback, low development cost, strong vendor client relationships, reqs prioritization, better job of risk analysis
* negative - lack of knowledge sharing, lack of face to face, skepticism towards agile dev, lack of mgmt commitment
* Failure rate is more than 65% (?) - Scaling agile is more difficult in a distributed environment
* SWOT - factors mapped (internal strengths and weaknesses, and external opportunities and threats)

### Software Acquisition Management
* broader term for outsourcing
* refers to vendorng out the development
* generic types: purchase off-the-shelf software from a supplier, contract with a supplier to develop software in conformance to a technical spec, engage the services of ppl
* Factors influencing outsourcing decision: 
   * need for specialized/advanced technology or capability
   * strategic value of system
   * cost
   * strategic alliance
   * maintenance support
   * speed of development
   * desire for level staffing
* Software Outsourcing Activites:
  * Define the work to be subcontracted
    * Partition the product and its activities
    * select the subcontracted work to: maximize the organization's effectiveness, match the skills and capabilities of potential subcontractors, minimize communication and coordination efforts, minimize dependencies, minimize risk of the subcontractor's knowledge not being transferred to the organization 
  * Develop the outsourcing plan
    * Develop a technical specification for the work
    * Develop a statement of work for the supplier (identify all tasks to be performed, relevant processes to be followed, maintenance responsibilities)
    * Perform risk mgmt (identify outsourcing risks early on, adjust acquisition strategy to minimize risks)
    * estimate resources needed, including: supplier development effort, effort for vendor mgmt
  * Select a subcontractor
    * Factors to consider in selecting a supplier: strategic business alliances, prior performance on similar work, geographic location, software engineering and software mgmt capabilities, available staff, domain expertise, cost, similarity of processes and tools, business viability 
  * Contract with the subcontractor
    * work with purchasing and legal department 
  * Oversee the development to ensure that is on schedule, within cost, and meeting reqs
    * A plan must be developed for supplier tracking and oversight
    * The plan must address: activities to be performed and the schedule to complete them, identification of groups, assigned responsibilities, and intergroup comm., techniques, tools, and methodologies for tracking and reviewing vendor performance, escalation procedures
    * tracking and oversight activities: maintaining good communication, visibility, conducting reviews, assessing metrics, continuous risk mgmt, approving invoices
  * Perform acceptance testing
    * acceptance testing is a formal procedure which has contract implications, acceptance testing must provide a convincing demo of the systems functionality in detail, the acceptance test must be constructed in a systemic manner 
  * Integrate the component into the product
    * component must be integrated into the product
    * documentation and test cases must be updated appropriately
    * component is placed under configuration mgmt 
* Components of outsourcing agreement: contract, statement of work, technical specs
* Supplier mgmt activities: selection - searching for and evaluating vendors, specifying legal terms of the contract, negotiating the contract; subcontract mgmt - conveying and explaining reqs, monitoring vendor, including reviews, resolving problems
* Ultimately, the work must be accepted and integrated into the product

#### A Process for Managing Risks in Distributed Teams
* To manage, managers must: know how to build teams across sites, how to breakdown and distribute work, how to share knowledge across time, space and cultural differences, how to coordinate work, how to manage risks
* Paper presents framework to manage risks, including web based tool
* Table 1 - taxonomy of risk areas
* Table 2 - techniques for approaching risk mgmt tied to risk areas
