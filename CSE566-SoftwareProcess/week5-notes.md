# Week 5 Notes

### Global Software Development
* entails geographically distributed team developing, testing and maintaining software
* What are the motivations?
   * cost reduction
   * insufficient sources locally
   * access to world-class capabilities and tech
   * proximity to markets
   * sharing benefits of resources from diff cultures & backgrounds
   * flexibility in skill mgmt
   * reduced cycle time
* Challenges to GSE:
   * Lack of strategy & shared values
   * Insufficient communication
   * Cultural differences
   * Dispersed work organization
   * Inadequate global mgmt
   * Isolated learning
   * Insufficient contract mgmt
   * Unknown legal environment
   * Different turnover rates
  
#### Scrum Practices and Global Software Development
* Literature review
* Benefits of global dev - improved quality, cheaper resources
* Challenges - collaboration and coordination (set of synchronized actions)
* How do you scale scrum?
* Utilizing Scrum - Sprint 0, then have potentially multiple scrum teams
* Have to have a mechanism
* SoS (Scrum of Scrums) - a representative of team goes into an equivalent of a stand up meeting

#### SWOT for Scaling Agile Methods in Global Software Development
* Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats
* Literature review
* 4 research questions - what the factors that contribute the most to large scale agile operations? Positive influences, negative influences, what are the most critical factors of both
* 6 most critical factors: feedback, low development cost, strong vendor client relationships, reqs prioritization, better job of risk analysis
* negative - lack of knowledge sharing, lack of face to face, skepticism towards agile dev, lack of mgmt commitment
* Failure rate is more than 65% (?) - Scaling agile is more difficult in a distributed environment
* SWOT - factors mapped (internal strengths and weaknesses, and external opportunities and threats)

### Software Acquisition Management
* broader term for outsourcing
* refers to vendorng out the development
* generic types: purchase off-the-shelf software from a supplier, contract with a supplier to develop software in conformance to a technical spec, engage the services of ppl
