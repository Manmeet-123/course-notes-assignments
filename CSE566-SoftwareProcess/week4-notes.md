# Week 4 Notes
## Cost Estimation Process
### Estimation Analogy
* Software Cost Estimation - Cost estimation process, cost estimation techniques
* Importance of Estimates - estimates are critical to the success of a project
* Estimates are the foundation for: the development budget, allocation of staff and resources, identification and quantification of risk
* Question: If $ = f (effort), then would size estimates include deleted code? Yes, because there is effort involved in modifying code, which also includes deleting code
* Major causes of inaccurate estimates: misunderstanding of requirements, overlooking tasks, poor and imprecise problem definition, insufficient analysis when developing estimates due to time pressure, lack of guidelines for estimations, lack of historical data, pressure to reduce estimate

### Generic Software Cost
* Estimation Process:
   * Determine estimation responsibilities
   * Review, clarify, and understand... reqs, deliverables, milestones, constraints
   * From requirements, identify estimatable tasks (earned values)
   * Select a size estimation method
   * Estimate and document size
   * estimate and document effort
 * importance of reqs - must agree on the job that needs to be done, provide a sound basis for resource estimation, improve quality, achievement of goals with minimum resources
 * Problem sources for reqs - customers have incomplete understanding of their needs, poor understanding of computer capabilities and limitations, analysts have poor knowledge of problem domain, users and analysts speak different languages, ease of omitting obvious information, different users have conflicting views, statements of requirements are often vague and untestable
 * Products can have the same functions but different attributes - reliability, maintainability, ease of use, performance
 * required attributes must be specified prior to estimation
 * a set of estimatable functions must be documented
 * select appropriate size measure - must differentiate among the different code categories - new code, modified, deleted code
 * top-down/analogy - expert develops an estimate based on past similar projects, doesn't work well for new types of projects
   * delphi technique - coordinator provides each estimator with the information needed to develop an estimate, estimators work by themselves to develop an estimate along with its justification
   * planning poker 
 * bottom-up - breaks a project into parts 
 * decomposition criteria - parts decomposed
 * How granular should Earned Value be - don't try to exceed 2 weeks, measurable inch-pebbles
 * Estimate and document Size
   * 80/20 rule applies to size estimation - spend more time estimating more accurately the size of the parts that contribute most to the estimate
   * communicate the accuracy of the size estimate
   * prior to effort estimation, the size of the work must be estimated and documented along with the basis of the estimate and the assumptions made
   * estimates of individual parts can be statistically combined to generate total estimates with prediction intervals
   * Basis of the Estimate (BOE)
* Estimating size with Prediction Intervals
   * to develop a total estimate with statistical confidence 3 values must be estimated for each individual part that contributes to the total: optimistic, most likely value, pessimistic
   * statistical prediction intervals can be generated by calculated the standard deviations of individual estimates and combining them to creat a confidence interval
   * 70% Prediction Interval
     * calculate the expected value of an individual estimate as: [optimistic + 4(most likely) + pessimistic]/6
     * calculate the standard deviation of an individual estimate as (pessimistic-optimistic)/6
     * calculate the standard deviation of the total as: square root of the sum of the individual variances
   *　calculate the 70% prediction interval as: expected value of the total estimate plus and minus the standard deviation of the total
   * Revising size estimates
     * changes in a project will almost inevitably trigger revisions to the size estimates
     * changes must be analyzed carefully and size estimates revised and documented to reflect:
       * new functions to be incorporated
       * changes to existing functions
       * changes to the basis of size estimation
       * appropriateness of current assumptions
       * new assumptions
     * the revision of size estimates provides an opportunity to adjust the estimate based on actual size measurements of completed part of the product
     * Estimate and Document Effort
       * select a size of unit of effort
       * actual effort is a function of: size estimates, estimated productivity, schedule
       * the effort estimate must be documented along with the basis for the estimate and the assumptions made
       * what is the impact on effort if the schedule must be shortened by adding ppl?
       * can we double the number of people and reduce the schedule by one-half
       * Rayleigh Norden Equations S = Ck * K^1/3 * td^4/3
         * S source lines
         * Ck tech constant
         * K effort
         * td development time
       * Revising Effort Estimates
         * Changes in a project will almost inevitably trigger revisions to the effort estimates
         * Changes must be analyzed:
          * changes to size of the work
       * Strategies for Checking Estimates
         * check that the proportion of resources planned for each phase of the project matches the proportion of resources expended on similar completed projects
         * review with experts
         * historical data, similar parts of the system, and already completed systems           
       * Algorithmic Estimation Models
         * follow a holistic approach to estimation in which an estimated size is converted to effort utilizing an estimation tool
         * COCOMO
         * COSTAR  
    
## Cost Estimation Techniques

### Estimation Techniques
* Estimation via - lines of code, function points, use case points, feature points

### The Business of Software: Estimation is not Evil
* distinction btwn estimation vs commitment
* 100% defining reqs is difficult and not needed for estimation
* need to have some idea of what the product will look like to decide if the return is worth the cost
* Estimate is an uncertainty range
* Commitment is the estimate plus a calculated reserve needed to deal with risk (eg poorly defined reqs)

### Core Estimating Concepts
* Step 1: Define High-level Object (HLOs) - yards of carpet, LOC, function points
* Step 2: Define adjusting variables - complexity of code, experience of team
* Step 3: Define productivity curves - 1 LOC/hr
* estimates must also address life cycle costs (maintenance)
* baseline of software evolves over time
* high-level estimates are used by mgmt
* 90% of projects from ROM (rough order) estimates are never started
* scope lvl estimate is "commit" - basis for planning project
* estimate is most likely outcome of a probabilistic event
* budget includes risk
* contingency
* According to reading, a way to validate an estimate is to compare bottom-up with parametric estimate or use different HLOs
* Estimating does not include risk
* Establishing a program baseline deals with identifying risk areas

### Estimation Tools and Techniques
* The keys to good estimation are people and data
* misunderstanding of goals, estimates and plans
* Technologies
   * expert judgement - brainstorming of one or more experts who have experience with similar projects and consensus
   * analogy - comparing previous projects and activities
   * decomposition - break into parts, WBS
   * statistical (parametric) - math equations to generate estimate
* tools are based on historical data
* Inetnational Software benchmarking standard
* tools all use LOC data - backfiring is used to convert LOC
* establish process to capture relevant data for your org
* determine accuracy needed for business
* work to improve existing formulas 

### Managing the Size of Your Projects
* Function points help measure what the software must do from an external, user perspective, irrespective of how the software is constructed
* based on the user perspective and a measure of the size of a software program
* requirements vs implementation
* are calculated in accordance with the International Function Point Users Group
* According to the function points as construction analogy, which metric-units relation is accurate in terms of IT units of measure? Estimated project size → FP
* Function Points Count - Internal logic files (ILFs), External Interface Files (EIFs), External inputs (EIs), External outputs (EOs), External queries (EQs)
* Steps in Function Points Counting
   * Step 1: Count the number of logical components of each type
   * Step 2: Calculate the complexity of each type based on IFPUG rules
   * Step 3: Sum values to produce Unadjusted FP count
   * Step 4: Determine value adjustment factor (VAF = .65 + (sum of GSCs x .01))  (For GSC, see the figure in the Notes doc)
   * Step 5: Calculate final adjusted FP - = Unadjusted FP x VAF
