* Importance of Estimates - estimates are critical to the success of a project
* Estimates are the foundation for: the development budget, allocation of staff and resources, identification and quantification of risk
* Question: If $ = f (effort), then would size estimates include deleted code? Yes, because there is effort involved in modifying code, which also includes deleting code
* Major causes of inaccurate estimates: misunderstanding of requirements, overlooking tasks, poor and imprecise problem definition, insufficient analysis when developing estimates due to time pressure, lack of guidelines for estimations, lack of historical data, pressure to reduce estimate
