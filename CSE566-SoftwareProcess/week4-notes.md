# Week 4 Notes
## Cost Estimation Process
### Estimation Analogy
* Software Cost Estimation - Cost estimation process, cost estimation techniques
* Importance of Estimates - estimates are critical to the success of a project
* Estimates are the foundation for: the development budget, allocation of staff and resources, identification and quantification of risk
* Question: If $ = f (effort), then would size estimates include deleted code? Yes, because there is effort involved in modifying code, which also includes deleting code
* Major causes of inaccurate estimates: misunderstanding of requirements, overlooking tasks, poor and imprecise problem definition, insufficient analysis when developing estimates due to time pressure, lack of guidelines for estimations, lack of historical data, pressure to reduce estimate

### Generic Software Cost
* Estimation Process:
   * Determine estimation responsibilities
   * Review, clarify, and understand... reqs, deliverables, milestones, constraints
   * From requirements, identify estimatable tasks (earned values)
   * Select a size estimation method
   * Estimate and document size
   * estimate and document effort
 * importance of reqs - must agree on the job that needs to be done, provide a sound basis for resource estimation, improve quality, achievement of goals with minimum resources
 * Problem sources for reqs - customers have incomplete understanding of their needs, poor understanding of computer capabilities and limitations, analysts have poor knowledge of problem domain, users and analysts speak different languages, ease of omitting obvious information, different users have conflicting views, statements of requirements are often vague and untestable
 * Products can have the same functions but different attributes - reliability, maintainability, ease of use, performance
 * required attributes must be specified prior to estimation
 * a set of estimatable functions must be documented
 * select appropriate size measure - must differentiate among the different code categories - new code, modified, deleted code
 * top-down/analogy - expert develops an estimate based on past similar projects, doesn't work well for new types of projects
   * delphi technique - coordinator provides each estimator with the information needed to develop an estimate, estimators work by themselves to develop an estimate along with its justification
   * planning poker 
 * bottom-up - breaks a project into parts 
 * decomposition criteria - parts decomposed
 * How granular should Earned Value be - don't try to exceed 2 weeks, measurable inch-pebbles
