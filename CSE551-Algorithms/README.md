# CSE 551 - Foundations of Algorithms

Algorithms, or a step-by-step process to efficiently reach the desired goal, have been part of human history since the 1200s. Algorithms are a fundamental component to any computerized system. In this foundational course, you will learn several different algorithms and be able to explain how they work and why they are considered good. This knowledge will help you:
1. Evaluate appropriate algorithmic techniques that can lead to more efficient solutions
for a problem, instead of just coding the first idea that comes to mind.
2. Develop sound background knowledge on algorithms that will allow you to navigate the field’s literature, beyond the context of this class.
