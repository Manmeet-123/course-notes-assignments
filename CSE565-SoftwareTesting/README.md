# Software Verification, Validation, and Testing

Software as a standalone product or embedded within a system plays an integral role in
our world today. As a consequence, it is essential that software works as expected.
This requires software testing which entails answering both the verification question: “
Are we building the product right?” and the validation question: “Are we building the
right product?”. Understanding these questions is crucial for developing good test
cases.
