# Discrete Mathematics

> UCSD Extension Course (CSE-41243), taken as a supplementary course. This isn't a graduate-level course, but I've always wanted to take a discrete math course, so I decided to take it this quarter. I don't have an undergrad degree related to Computer Science and up until getting into a master's program, everything I've learned related to Computer Science has been self-taught.

Discrete math is applied math: it provides the basis for much of computer science, statistics, and programming, as well as being integral to engineering and many different scientific disciplines.
