# Discrete Mathematics

UCSD Extension Course, taken as a supplementary course. I don't have a background and CS and am largely self-taught. I've always wanted to take a discrete math course, so I decided to take it this quarter.

Discrete math is applied math: it provides the basis for much of computer science, statistics, and programming, as well as being integral to engineering and many different scientific disciplines.
