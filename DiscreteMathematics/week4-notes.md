# Week 4 - Sets and Ordering

* A set is a collection of distinct objects
* Each object in the set is called an element or member
* Represent set by describing its elements inside a pair of curly brackets
   * S={a,3,5}
* Instead of listing every single element we sometimes use rules to describe sets
   * S = {x| xœµZ, 3<=x<=5}= {3,4,5}
* The size of a finite set is the number of ts elements
* Venn diagrams can represent sets and their relations visually
* Subset is a portion of a set; so it is also a set whose elements are contained in the original set
* Power set is a set of all subsets of set S or P(S)
