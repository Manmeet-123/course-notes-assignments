# Week 2 - Integer Functions

* Integers - include positive and negative numbers
* Real numbers - found on the number line (computers - floating points)
* A function is mapping from a set to another set, usually using a rule
* Floor - the floor function is the function that takes as input a real number x, and gives as output the greatest integer less than or equal to x, denoted floor(x) or ⌊x⌋
* Ceiling - the ceiling function maps x to the least integer greater than or equal to x, denoted ceil(x) or ⌈x⌉
* Floor of X is also called the integer part of X or int(x) and is shown by [x] as well
* X - [X] is called the fractional part or frac(x)
* Quantization: converting continuous values into a discrete set of values, e.g. analog to digital signal!
