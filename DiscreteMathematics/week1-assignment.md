# Assignment 1 - Logic


**1. Using	a	truth	table,	prove	De	Morgan’s	laws as	follows:
¬ (p⋁q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q & ¬ (p⋀q) ≡ ¬p⋁¬q**

**2. Construct	a	logical	statement	for	S(p,q)	such	that	it	has	the	following	truth	
table. (The	statement	should	only	consist	of	p,	q	and	logical	connectives.)**
|p|q|S(p,	q)|
|--|--|:--:|
|T| T |F|
|T| F |F|
|F| T| T|
|F| F| F|

**4. Let	p	and	q	be variables	with	truth-values 0	or	1.	Find	logical	expressions	of	p	
and	q	that	represent	binary	addition and	multiplication	of	their	truth-value.
Hint. Complete	the	following table,	and	treat	it	as	a	truth	table.	Then	find	
expressions	for	sum,	carry	and	product.**

**Optional.	There	are	two	men.	One	of	them	is	wearing	a	red	shirt,	and	the	other	is	
wearing	a	blue	shirt.	The	two	men	are	named	Andrew	and	Bob,	but	we	do	not	know	
which	is	Andrew	and	which	is	Bob.
The	guy	in	the	blue	shirt	says,	“I	am	Andrew.”	
The	guy	in	the	red	shirt	says,	“I	am	Bob.”
If	we	know	that	at	least	one	of	them	lied,	then	what	color	shirt	is	Andrew wearing?**
